# 1_Variable_Linear_Equation
Thank You For Your Guys, Single Variable Linear Equation :- -------------------------------- ax+b=c x=(c-b)/a where a,b and c are the coefficients and constants of the equations let for example, 3x+9=18 =>x=(18-9)/3 =>x=3 **This program is valid for those equation which folowed the above directional rule the modified version will be uploaded soon.
